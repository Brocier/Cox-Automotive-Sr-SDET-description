# Job Description

## Senior Software Developer in Test

### Manheim

---

### Qualifications

- Bachelor's Degree in computer science or related field or **relevant IT experience**

- 5+ years test automation development experience in Java, **Ruby** or the same years of experience in an equivalent Object Oriented language

I've done some work in pure Ruby, but have mostly used Rails in my OO experience.

- In-cycle experience in Test Automation in an **Agile** environment

My internship with Helium was an agile environment, in that we had daily standup meetings, sprint planning sessions, and we would often pair program.

- &#9745; Demonstrated knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- 5+ years of **UNIX** or Linux shell command experience

- Demonstrated knowledge of **continuous integration and continuous deployment** best practices and build tools i.e., Rake, Maven and Ant

I have heard of Rake from using Rails, but hadn't heard of Maven and Ant. Some brief research leads me to believe they are the build processes used with the legacy backend written in Java.

My initial thoughts on CI and CD relate to my use of github and netlify. I am a big fan of automated processes that take care of the grunt-work of building out my sites. An extremely simple example of that is my use of the Netlify CMS in my personal portfolio. I was very attracted to the idea of a CMS that would also interact with my github account to show commit logs and times with every content creation and update. Why reinvent the wheel of version control, when git is already in my tool bag.

**My question to Manheim**, do you use Docker, or some other containerization suite to keep each of the pieces of the project separate? How does that affect your plans for CICD?

- Experience with version control tools like **Git** or SVN

- 3+ Years Experience in writing SQL queries and strong **knowledge in relational database structures**

**My question to Manheim**, do you use pure SQL instead of Active Record?

All of my SQL queries ended up being written through Rail's Active Record system. None of my relationships were complicated enough to need deep or complex queries with SQL syntax. In Helium I did encounter a problem that required verifying if a user was an admin, and at what level. My mentor transferred my work from AR to SQL and made it extremely efficient. My problem is I felt like I was reading elvish as he wrote it.

- Strong familiarity with SOAP and **REST**

RESTful routing was the standard when I went through General Assembly's web development course. As such, I'm most familiar with the ideas of CRUD and the structure it gave to my API calls. It looks like SOAP is an even more structured architecture to those API calls, but can be cumbersome for simple tasks. Because of my lack of familiarity with HTTP standards, I'm not sure how those two relate to the new guy on the block, graphQL. Personally I've really enjoyed the accessability gQL has brought to my personal projects APIs, but I'd be wary to use it on a large enterprise system.

- Proven expertise in engineering best practices in unit, functional and non-functional testing

**My question to Manheim**, would non-functional testing look like the Lighthouse Audit that Chrome has build into it? How else could you automate non-functional tests?

- Exposure to NoSQL databases such as Cassandra or CouchDB

I trained in MongoDB at General Assembly. Because of the lack of size in my projects I didn't see the performance difference between NoSQL and SQL that I was told about.

- Excellent interpersonal and communication skills

I am a huge proponent of team building and collaboration.
